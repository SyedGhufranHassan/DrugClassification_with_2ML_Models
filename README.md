# DrugClassification_with_2ML_Models
This repository contains an in-depth analysis and implementation of two popular machine learning models, Decision Tree and Random Forest, for classifying drugs using a drug classification dataset.
The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison of both models to determine their effectiveness in drug classification.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Implementation:
Decision Tree: Building and training a Decision Tree classifier.
Random Forest: Building and training a Random Forest classifier, which uses an ensemble of Decision Trees for improved accuracy and robustness.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of both models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Comparison: Detailed comparison of the two models to highlight their strengths and weaknesses in the context of drug classification
